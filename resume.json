He never backs down from any challenge or new learning thrown at him and made sure he stepped out of the comfort zone to achieve the feat. He has got experience working as Developer and Secops  - Jack of all trades. He also impressed everyone with his sheer dedication to work. Apart from professional development, he has done some fantastic work in his personal skill development. One thing really impressed me how he was able to adapt himself to the new work environment and quickly start initiating projects. His  knowledge in network and application level security is quite impressive. He is definitely a quick learner and with the skillset that he poses, he is really a good security engineer."
