        "summary": "Hi ! I am Aseem. I completed my higher education from DPS RKP and then graduated in CS from IIIT Allahabad. While in college, I've been the coordinator for cybersecurity wing and our college CTF team participated and won many of the national and international CTFs. Apart from CTFs, I also reported some critical bugs to governments and organisations one of which has been covered in Economic Times in September this year. Recently I've started teaching about cybersecurity on my youtube channel HackingSimplified. I love to run ( hope to run a marathon some day ) and read books.",
